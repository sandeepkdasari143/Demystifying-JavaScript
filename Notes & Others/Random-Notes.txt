What is Lexical Environment?
Whenever Global Execution Context is created, the Lexical Environment is also created. Lexical environment is a local memory along with the lexical environment of it's parent.

-> Lexical means "in heirarchy" or "in a sequence".

function a(){
	var b= 10;
	c();
	function c(){
		...
	}
}

a();

-> c func() is lexically inside a func().
-> where that code is present physically inside where?
-> a func() is lexically inside the global scope.

-> Local Memory along with Lexical environment of it's Parent.

-> Whenever the Global Execution Context is created, then in the Memory Allocation part, The reference of the Local Memory as well as Lexical Environment of it's Parent also been created.

-> Scope Chaining is the chain of all the lexical environments of it's parent's references.

-> Lexical Environment = Local Memory + Lexical Environment of it's Parent(where it's lexically present).

-> Scope is defined that, whether a function or variable present inside the Scope Chain.
