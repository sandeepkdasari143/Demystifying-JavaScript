What is a Callback Function in Javascript

-> You can take a function which can be passed into another function, the function which has been passed is called CallBack Function.

-> With the help of "callback" functions, we can do "asynchronous" tasks in a synchronous - single threaded Javascript.

Example: setTimeout(handler, delay);
"handler is the call back function."

Power of a Callbacks?

Deep about the Event Listeners?

document.getElementById("clickMe")
.addEventListener("click", function cb(){
	console.log("Button Clicked!");
})


-> Even Listeners are heavy, It consumes the Memory. The program can't free up the Memory which stores the Event Listeners.
e.g., onclicke, onclose, onscroll, onhover
